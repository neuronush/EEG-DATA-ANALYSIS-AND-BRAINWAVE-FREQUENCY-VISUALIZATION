# EEG-DATA-ANALYSIS-AND-BRAINWAVE-FREQUENCY-VISUALIZATION
The aim of this project was to analyze EEG (Electroencephalogram) data and visualize brainwave frequencies using Python. I performed preprocessing of the EEG data, performed Fourier Transform to extract frequency information, and visualized the power spectrum using bar graphs and heatmaps. Additionally, I also created topographic maps to showcase the spatial distribution of brainwave frequencies across different EEG channels.
